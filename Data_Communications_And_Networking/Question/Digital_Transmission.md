# 1. List three techniques of digital-to-digital conversion.
line coding, block coding, scrambling.

# 2. Distinguish between a signal element and a data element.
In digital data communications, a signal element carries data elements.

# 3. Distinguish between data rate and signal rate.
1. The **data rate** defines the number of data elements sent in 1s.
2. The **signal rate** is the number of signal elements sent in 1s.

# 4. Define baseline wandering and its  effect on digital transmission.
A long string of 0s and 1s can cause a drift in the baseline (**baseline wandering**) and make it difficult for the receiver to decode correctly.

# 5. Define a DC component and its effect on digital transmission.
These frequencies around zero, called DC (direct-current) components, present problems for a system that cannot pass low frequencies or a system that uses electrical coupling.

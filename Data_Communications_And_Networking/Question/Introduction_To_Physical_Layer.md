# 1. What is the relationship between period and frequency?
period = 1 / frequency

# 2. What does the amplitude of a signal measure? What does the frequency of a signal measure? What does the phase of a signal measure?
1. The **peak amplitude** of a signal is the absolute value of its highest intensity, proportional to the energy it carries.
2. **Frequency** refers to the number of periods in 1s.
3. **Phase** describles the position of waveform relative to time 0.

# 3. How can a composite signal be decomposed into its individual frequencies?
According to Fourier analysis, any composite signal is a combination of simple sine waves with different frequencies, amplitudes, and phases.

# 4. Name the types of transmission impairment.
Attenuation, Distortion, Noise.

# 5. Distinguish between baseband transmission and broadband transmission.
1. Baseband transmission means sending a digital signal over a channel without changing the digital signal to an analog signal.
2. Broadband transmission or modulation means changing the digital signal to an analog signal for transmission.

# 6. Distingusih between a low-pass channel and a band-pass channel.
1. A **low-pass channel**, a channel with a bandwith that starts from zero.
2. A **band-pass channel**, a channel with a bandwith that does not start from zero.

# 7. What does the Nyquist theorem have to do with communication?

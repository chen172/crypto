# 1. What is the relationship between period and frequency?
period = 1 / frequency

# 2. What does the amplitude of a signal measure? What does the frequency of a signal measure? What does the phase of a signal measure?
1. The **peak amplitude** of a signal is the absolute value of its highest intensity, proportional to the energy it carries.
2. **Frequency** refers to the number of periods in 1s.
3. **Phase** describles the position of waveform relative to time 0.

# 3. How can a composite signal be decomposed into its individual frequencies?
According to Fourier analysis, any composite signal is a combination of simple sine waves with different frequencies, amplitudes, and phases.

# 4. Name the types of transmission impairment.
Attenuation, Distortion, Noise.

# 5. Distinguish between baseband transmission and broadband transmission.
1. Baseband transmission means sending a digital signal over a channel without changing the digital signal to an analog signal.
2. Broadband transmission or modulation means changing the digital signal to an analog signal for transmission.

# 6. Distingusih between a low-pass channel and a band-pass channel.
1. A **low-pass channel**, a channel with a bandwith that starts from zero.
2. A **band-pass channel**, a channel with a bandwith that does not start from zero.

# 7. What does the Nyquist theorem have to do with communication?
For a noiseless channel, the Nyquist bit rate formula defines the theoretical maximum bit rate.

# 8. What does the Shannon capacity have to do with communication?
Shannon capacity determines the theoretical highest data rate for a noisy channel.

# 9. Why do optical signals used in fiber optic cables have a very short wave length?
Low speed and high frequency.

# 10. Can we say whether a signal is periodic or nonperiodic by just looking at its frequency domain plot? How?
Yes, if signal is periodic, its frequency domain is discrete.

# 11. Is the frequency domain plot of voice signal discrete or continuous?
continuous.

# 12. Is the frequency doamin plot of an alarm system discrete or continuous?
discrete.

# 13. We send a voice signal from a microphone to a recorder. Is this baseband or braodband transmission.
braodband transmission.

# 14. We send a digital signal from one station on a LAN to another station. Is this baseband or broadband transmission?
baseband.

# 15. We modulate several voice signals and send them through the air. Is this baseband or broadband transmisssion?
broadband transmission.

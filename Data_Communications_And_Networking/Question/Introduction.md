# 1. Identify the five components of a data communications system.
1. Message
2. Sender
3. Receiver
4. Transmission medium
5. Protocol

# 2. What are the three criteria necessary for an effective and efficient network?
1. Performance
2. Reliability
3. Security

# 3. What are the advantages of a multipoint connection over a point-to-point one?
In a multipoint environment, the capacity of the channel is shared, either spatially or temporally.

# 4. What are the two types of line configuration?
point-to-point and multipoint.

# 5. Categorize the four basic topologies in terms of line configuration?
1. Mesh Topology 
2. Star Topology
3. Bus Topology
4. Ring Topology

# 6. What is the difference between half-duplex and full-deplex transmission modes?
1. half-duplex is one direction at a time.
2. full-deplex is both direction at all the time.

Answer for the book:
In **half-duplex mode**, each station can both transmit and receive, but not at the same time.

In **full-deplex mode**, both stations can transmit and receive simultaneously.

# 7. Name the four basic network topologies, and cite an advantages of each type.
1. Mesh topology. A mesh offers several advantages over other network topologies. 
* First, the use of dedicated links guarantees that each connection can carry its own data load, thus eliminating the traffic problems that can occur when links must be shared by multiple devices.
* Second,

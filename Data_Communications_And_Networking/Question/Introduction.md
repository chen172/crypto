# 1. Identify the five components of a data communications system.
1. Message
2. Sender
3. Receiver
4. Transmission medium
5. Protocol

# 2. What are the three criteria necessary for an effective and efficient network?
1. Performance
2. Reliability
3. Security

# 3. What are the advantages of a multipoint connection over a point-to-point one?
In a multipoint environment, the capacity of the channel is shared, either spatially or temporally.

# 4. What are the two types of line configuration?
point-to-point and multipoint.

# 5. Categorize the four basic topologies in terms of line configuration?
1. Mesh Topology 
2. Star Topology
3. Bus Topology
4. Ring Topology

# 6. What is the difference between half-duplex and full-deplex transmission modes?
1. half-duplex is one direction at a time.
2. full-deplex is both direction at all the time.

Answer for the book:
In **half-duplex mode**, each station can both transmit and receive, but not at the same time.

In **full-deplex mode**, both stations can transmit and receive simultaneously.

# 7. Name the four basic network topologies, and cite an advantages of each type.
1. Mesh topology. A mesh offers several advantages over other network topologies. 
* First, the use of dedicated links guarantees that each connection can carry its own data load, thus eliminating the traffic problems that can occur when links must be shared by multiple devices.
* Second, a mesh topology is robust. If one link becomes unusable, it does not incapacitate the entire system.
* Third, there is the advantage of privacy or security. When every message travels along a dedicated line, only the intended recipient sees it. Physical boundaries prevent other users from gaining access to messages.
* Finally, point-to-point links make fault identification and fault isolation easy. Traffic can be routed to avoid links with suspected problems.

2. Star topology. A star offers several advantages:
* A star topology is less expensive than a mesh topology.
* robustness. If one link fails, only that link is affected.

3. Bus topology. Advantages of a bus topology include ease of installation.

4. Ring topology. A ring is easy to install and reconfigure.

# 8. For n devices in a network, what is the number of cable links required for a mesh, ring, bus, and star topology?
1. mesh, n*(n-1)/2
2. ring, 1
3. bus, 1
4. star, n

# 9. What are some of the factors that determine whether a communication system is a LAN or WAN?
Size, geographical coverage, and ownership.

# 10. What is an internet? What is the Internet?
1. When two or more networks are connected, they make an **internetwork**, or **internet**.
2. The most notable internet is called the **Internet**, and is composed of thousands of interconnected networks.

# 11. Why are protocols needed?
Without a protocol, two devices may be connected but not communicating.

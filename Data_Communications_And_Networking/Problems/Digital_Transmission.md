# 1. Calculate the value of the signal rate for each case in Figure 4.2 if the data rate is 1 Mbps and c = 1/2.
a. 0,5 Mbaud

b. 0.25 Mbaud

c. 1 Mbaud

d. 2/3 Mbaud

# 2. In a digital transmission, the sender clock is 0.2 percent faster than the receiver colok. How many extra bits per second does the sender send if the data rate is 1 Mbps?
1000000 * 0.002 = 2000 bit

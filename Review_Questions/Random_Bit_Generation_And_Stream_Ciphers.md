# 1.What is the difference between statisical randomness and unpredictability?
Randomness and unpredictability are two distinct and not necessarily compatible 
requirements for a sequence of random numbers.

**Randomness** Traditionally, the concern in the gerneration of a sequence of 
allegedly random numbers has been that the sequence of numbers be random in some 
well-defined statistical sense.The following two criteria are used to validate
that a sequence of numbers is random:
- Uniform distribution: The distribution of bits in the sequence should be uniform;
that is, the frequency of occurrence of ones and zeros should be approximately equal.
- Independence: No one subsequene in the sequence can be inferred from the others.

**Unpredictability** The successive numbers of sequence are unpredictable. Care must be 
taken that an opponent not be able to predict future elements of the sequence on the 
basis of earlier elements.

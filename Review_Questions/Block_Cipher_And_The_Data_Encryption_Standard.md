# 1. Why is it important to study the Feistel cipher?
Several important symmetric block encryption algorithms in current use are based on a structure referred to as a Feistel 
block cipher.

# 2. What is the difference between a block cipher and a stream cipher?
1. A **stream cipher** is one that encrypts a digital data stream one bit or one byte at a time.
2. A **block cipher** is one in which a block of plaintext is treated as a whole and used to produce a ciphertext block of equal length.
